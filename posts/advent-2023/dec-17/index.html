That's a lot of languages to know on top of all the other things he has to do. Luckily he has his trusty polyglot elf, Rosetta, at his side. Bet you didn't know that!</p><h3>Welcome to Day 17 of the YAMLScript Advent Calendar</h3><p>A cool guy named Mike Mol made a website called <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">Rosetta Code</a> for programmers who want to learn all the programming languages of the world!</p><p>It's a wiki that has well over 1000 programming tasks and almost 1000 programming languages. The idea is for people to contribute solutions to the tasks in as many languages as they can.</p><p>I've been a fan of Rosetta Code for years. Here's one of my all time favorite programs from the site: <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz/EsoLang#SNUSP">FizzBuzz in SNUSP</a>!!</p><p>One thing people like to use Rosetta Code for is to show off a new language. YAMLScript is a new language, and I've put a few solutions up there myself:</p><ul><li><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer#YAMLScript">99 Bottles of Beer</a></li><li><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz#YAMLScript">FizzBuzz</a></li><li><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text#YAMLScript">Hello world/Text</a></li><li><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Factorial#YAMLScript">Factorial</a></li><li><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence#YAMLScript">Fibonacci sequence</a></li></ul><p>Adding solutions to Rosetta Code is a one of the best ways I've found to figure out what YAMLScript needs to do and what it needs to do better.</p><h3>Rosetta Code Data</h3><p>The Rosetta Code website is a great resource, but it's a bit clunky to use. It would be really cool if all the code examples were available in a nice Git repository.</p><p>Well, it turns out that they are! You can clone over 100,000 code examples in a few seconds by running this command:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> clone https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData<br>$ <span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> RosettaCodeData<br>$ <span class="token function">ls</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-l</span> Lang/YAMLScript/<br>total <span class="token number">8</span><br>00-<span class="token environment constant">LANG</span>.txt<br>00-META.yaml<br><span class="token number">99</span>-bottles-of-beer -<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">..</span>/<span class="token punctuation">..</span>/Task/99-bottles-of-beer/YAMLScript/<br>Factorial -<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">..</span>/<span class="token punctuation">..</span>/Task/Factorial/YAMLScript/<br>Fibonacci-sequence -<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">..</span>/<span class="token punctuation">..</span>/Task/Fibonacci-sequence/YAMLScript/<br>FizzBuzz -<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">..</span>/<span class="token punctuation">..</span>/Task/FizzBuzz/YAMLScript/<br>Hello-world-Text -<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">..</span>/<span class="token punctuation">..</span>/Task/Hello-world-Text/YAMLScript/</code></pre><p>The Rosetta Code Data Project is something I wrote almost 15 years ago. This last summer I was able to make it a lot easier to update.</p><p>Let's try out the FizzBuzz example:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ ys Task/FizzBuzz/YAMLScript/fizzbuzz.ys <span class="token number">16</span><br><span class="token number">1</span><br><span class="token number">2</span><br>Fizz<br><span class="token number">4</span><br>Buzz<br>Fizz<br><span class="token number">7</span><br><span class="token number">8</span><br>Fizz<br>Buzz<br><span class="token number">11</span><br>Fizz<br><span class="token number">13</span><br><span class="token number">14</span><br>FizzBuzz<br><span class="token number">16</span></code></pre><p>Pretty cool, huh?</p><p>Don't wait for me to add more YAMLScript solutions to Rosetta Code. You can do it yourself! If you do, send me a DM on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1011262808001880065/">Rosetta Code Discord</a> server and I'll update the Rosetta Code Data Project repo with your solutions.</p><p>If you had never heard of Rosetta Code before, I hope you'll find it as interesting as I do.</p><p>Check back tomorrow for Day 18 of the YAMLScript Advent Calendar!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><details><summary style="color:#888">Santa's little secrets...</summary><p>In December 2023 YAMLScript is a work in progress.</p><p>This is not to say that it's vaporware, or a toy proof of concept. It has a working compiler, runtime and CLI. It has unit tests that must pass for every commit pushed to the main branch. It's well thought out and has a clear direction that I continually vet with a small group of talented and trusted people.</p><p>But that in turn not to say that you should use it in production today. I encourage you to start playing with it, and I'm committed to backwards compatibility for stable releases. But we're not quite there yet. Caveat usor!</p><p>YAMLScript is evolving fast. While I'm writing these posts, I'm also writing the code for new features and fixing bugs as I go. I've had the Advent plan for over a month now, and I had planned to be further along before December 1st, but such are the time estimates of hackers.</p><p>I am attempting to make sure that the code examples in these posts are always using the implemented features, but sometimes I may fall a few hours behind. Often I need to write the examples using code patterns that actually work but are not the ones I preferred to best make a point.</p><p>As I fix bugs, implement features and tweak the language, I will update the posts accordingly. If you see something that bugs you, try taking another look after a few days. It probably bugged me too!</p><p>Be patient with me.</p><p>If I had to guess, I'd say that YAMLScript v0 will be have a stable release sometime before March 2024. I'll continue blogging the progress as I go, so it shouldn't be hard for you to decide when to start using YAMLScript for real.</p><p>Overall the whole thing is going extremely well, and I'm having a lot of fun. It's important to be transparent with you about where things are at.</p><p>Stick with me... This is going to be awesome!</p><p>— Ingy döt Net</p></details></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/blog/">#blog</a> <a href="/tags/advent-2023/">#advent-2023</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/advent-2023/dec-16/"><span>←</span> <span>Let Lambda Come Over</span> </a><a href="/posts/advent-2023/index/"><span>2023 Advent Index</span> <span>→</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>.
